# The Place (FSD, React, Typescript, React Router, Context, Rest API, Vite)

Single page application (SPA) on React. Written with functional components on Typescript. User has access to authentication and the whole application functionality outside of the authorization:

- view feed of pictures from other users
- add your own pictures
- edit profile and user avatar
- change theme
- like, unlike and delete pictures
- validation of data on the application side
- user authentication and authorization with JWT token

### One of the main goal was to try FSD aproach and implement it in project
